## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid
---
id: pgpool-prestop-drain-contract-verification
requirements:
  get_alias:
    id: R1
    text: "GET /drain returns the same draining response as POST and flips readiness through the shared controller."
    kind: regression
    risk: high
    verify: cargo test -p pgpool prestop_get_drain
  rendered_hook:
    id: R2
    text: "The rendered Deployment preStop hook invokes GET /drain and the offline contract lists that route."
    kind: conformance
    risk: high
    verify: cargo test -p pgpool served_contract_matches_offline_spec
