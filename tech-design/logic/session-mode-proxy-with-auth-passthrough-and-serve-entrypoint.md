summary: pgpool `serve` entrypoint and session-mode (1:1) proxy - a tcp-server TcpHandler-backed frontend listener with ConnectionBudget admission and a wire-level ErrorResponse rejection when saturated, a per-client backend TCP connection with frame-aware auth passthrough (cleartext/MD5/SCRAM relayed via decode+re-encode of the wire codec's typed messages, credentials never persisted), bidirectional relay until Terminate/EOF, and server-core DrainController-driven graceful shutdown bounded by a drain timeout.

    claim: serve-entrypoint-and-drain
    coverage: full
    rationale: "Defines and closes the serve-entrypoint-and-drain work root: the pgpool serve CLI verb, tcp-server-backed frontend listener with ConnectionBudget admission, per-client 1:1 backend session proxy with auth passthrough, and drain-bounded graceful shutdown, verified by cargo test -p pgpool --test session_proxy against a real Postgres backend (graceful-skip) plus offline unit coverage."

    claim: serve-by-default-entrypoint
    coverage: full
    rationale: "Adds the pgpool serve subcommand to the compiled CLI (cargo test -p pgpool --test cli_contract) and to the llm workflow topic, closing the serve-by-default-entrypoint work root's remaining gap: the process entrypoint that actually admits clients."

# SessionProxyConfig — backend endpoint, admission, and timeout defaults for
# `pgpool serve`'s session-mode (1:1) proxy. No pooling/transaction-mode or
# TLS config lives here (out of scope for this slice). frontend_budget and
# the frontend bind/socket options continue to come from RuntimePlan
# (max_frontend_connections / frontend_bind / frontend_socket, see
# apps/pgpool/src/lib.rs); this section adds only the backend-endpoint and
# session-proxy-specific seam RuntimePlan does not yet own.

# Backend endpoint (R3) — single configured Postgres backend this session-mode
# proxy dials per client; env var takes precedence, CLI flag overrides env.
backend_host:

backend_connect_timeout_ms:
  env: PGPOOL_BACKEND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS
  flag: --backend-connect-timeout-ms
  default: 5000        # 5s; exceeding this produces RejectionReason::BackendUnreachable / SQLSTATE 08006

# Frontend listener bind (R1) — reuses RuntimePlan::frontend_bind/frontend_socket
# defaults (any:6432, TcpSocketOptions::default()); `pgpool serve` does not
# introduce a second bind config, only surfaces the existing ones as CLI flags.
frontend_bind_override:
  env: PGPOOL_FRONTEND_BIND
  flag: --bind
  default: null        # null = use RuntimePlan::frontend_bind (0.0.0.0:6432) unchanged

# Drain timeout (R4 / AC4) — bounds how long an in-flight session may keep
# running after SIGTERM/SIGINT before the drain loop abandons it; shared by
# tcp_server::TcpServerConfig.drain_timeout and SessionProxyConfig.drain_timeout
# so there is one source of truth for the bounded-drain proof.
drain_timeout_ms:
  env: PGPOOL_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS
  flag: --drain-timeout-ms
  default: 30000        # 30s; matches server-core's shutdown_with_drain style bounded-wait convention

# Frontend admission budget (R1 / AC3) — reused from RuntimePlan, not
# reconfigured here; listed for traceability only.
max_frontend_connections:
  source: "RuntimePlan::max_frontend_connections"
  default: 10000        # ConnectionBudget::new(10_000); checked inside SessionHandler::handle, not via tcp_server::TcpServerConfig.connection_budget (see Schema: SessionProxyConfig.frontend_budget)
