### Backend identity contract

`pgpool serve` derives the deterministic backend identity `pgpool-<pod>` from
`PGPOOL_POD_NAME`; Kubernetes supplies the pod component through the Downward
API and local execution uses a stable non-empty default. The shared startup
normalizer removes every client-supplied `application_name` parameter, preserves
the relative order of every other parameter, and appends exactly one controlled
identity. Session mode, legacy transaction mode, and the dense-buffer reactor
call that normalizer before retaining or forwarding the startup. Every replay
lookup, replay publication, and bootstrap connection therefore keys on the
rewritten startup and every physical backend observes that same identity.

### Discovery contract

One PostgreSQL query returns raw `max_connections`, raw
`superuser_reserved_connections`, the count of `client backend` sessions, and
the pgpool subset whose application name begins `pgpool-`. Background workers
are excluded before total and foreign usage are formed. The effective connection
limit is `min(runtime_max, configured_ceiling?, advisory_ceiling?) -
superuser_reserved_connections`, using saturating arithmetic; foreign usage is
`client_total - pgpool_connections`, also saturating. Endpoint reserve and
safety headroom remain independent deductions in `EndpointCapacity::usable`.

### Reconcile contract

The reconciler evaluates new desired replicas against this corrected usable
capacity. It keeps the existing fail-closed rule for an unavailable discovery
or a genuine scale-out overage. Correctly classified active pgpool backends
must not turn an unchanged desired/current target into `Blocked`; status then
continues to describe normal readiness rather than a fabricated capacity fault.
