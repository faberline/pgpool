## Logic

entry: runtime
nodes:
  runtime: { kind: start, label: "Tokio runtime selection" }
  workers: { kind: process, label: "Multiple executor workers run independent relay tasks" }
  semantics: { kind: process, label: "Existing wire protocol and pool state machine" }
  result: { kind: terminal, label: "Same isolation with higher CPU concurrency" }

## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid

id: pgpool-multithread-runtime-contract-verification
requirements:
  isolation:

    text: "Changing runtime worker scheduling does not change transaction pooling reset or lease isolation behavior."
    kind: regression
    risk: high
    verify: cargo test -p pgpool --lib --test pool_modes
  throughput_evidence:
    id: R2
    text: "A corrected release benchmark produces a complete no-error comparison result."
