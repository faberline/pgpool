id: apps-pgpool-admin-plane
summary: Served admin HTTP plane for pgpool - a hand-rolled axum router bound on `RuntimePlan.admin_bind` via `http_server::serve_h2c_with_options`, exposing `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` (Prometheus), `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `GET /pools`, `GET /pools/{pool}/stats`, and `POST /drain`. A single shared `server_core::DrainController` (constructed once in `serve()` and cloned into both the TCP frontend's `TcpServerConfig.drain` and the admin plane's readiness/drain handlers) makes `/readyz` and the data-plane accept loop react identically to SIGTERM/SIGINT and to `POST /drain`, so in-flight sessions/transactions finish before the process exits. `/openapi.json` and `/pools`/`/pools/{pool}/stats` responses are built directly from the existing `apps/pgpool/src/spec.rs` JSON value and the WI #1289 `pool::BackendPool::stats()`/`PoolStats` accounting so the served contract and the offline `pgpool spec` inventory share one source of truth (R4/AC3) instead of round-tripping through a separately-typed OpenAPI document.

title: pgpool Admin Plane Types
description: >
  Types for the served admin HTTP plane in `apps/pgpool/src/admin/`: the
  shared router state (one shared DrainController clone plus the named pool
  registry), the named-pool wrapper the admin plane adds on top of WI #1289's
  `pool::BackendPool`/`pool::BackendPoolStats` (which carry no name/mode
  fields), and the wire-shape response bodies for `/pools`,
  `/pools/{pool}/stats`, and `POST /drain`. `PoolList`/`PoolStats` reuse the
  exact field shape `apps/pgpool/src/spec.rs`'s offline `schemas()` already
  declares (R4/AC3 byte-for-byte parity with `pgpool spec --format openapi`);
  this section does not redefine `apps::pgpool::pool::{PoolConfig,
  BackendPoolStats}`, `server_core::{DrainController, DrainState as
  CoreDrainState}`, or `server_core::ConnectionBudget` — it composes them.

definitions:
  NamedPool:

    description: "Pairs one WI #1289 BackendPool (Arc-backed, cheap to clone) with the pool name and PoolMode the admin plane needs to answer /pools and /pools/{pool}/stats, since pool::types::PoolStats/BackendPoolStats carry no name/mode fields themselves (R3). Constructed once in `serve()` from RuntimePlan.pool_name (Config section) + RuntimePlan.pool_mode and stored in AdminState.pools."

      budget:

      pool:
        x-rust-type: "crate::pool::BackendPool"

## Config

```yaml
# Admin plane config additions for `pgpool serve` (apps/pgpool/src/bin/pgpool.rs
# ServeArgs). No new pooling/backend config lives here (unchanged from WI
# #1288/#1289); this section adds only the admin-bind override and the
# pool-name the admin plane needs to label PoolStats/metrics, since
# RuntimePlan is single-pool-per-process today (R1, R3).

# Admin plane bind override (R1) — RuntimePlan::default() already binds the
# admin HTTP plane to 0.0.0.0:9080; this flag/env lets operators override it
# the same way --bind already overrides the frontend bind.
admin_bind_override:
  env: PGPOOL_ADMIN_BIND
  flag: --admin-bind
  default: null        # null = use RuntimePlan::admin_bind (0.0.0.0:9080) unchanged

# Pool name (R3) — labels this process's single BackendPool in PoolStats.name,
# the {pool} path segment in GET /pools/{pool}/stats, and the pool=<name>
# label on every /metrics gauge line. pgpool runs exactly one pool per
# process today, so this is a display/addressing label, not a multi-pool
# selector.
pool_name:
  env: PGPOOL_POOL_NAME
  flag: --pool-name
  default: "default"

# Admin plane drain timeout (R2 / AC2) — bounds how long the admin HTTP
# plane's own http_server::serve_h2c_with_options shutdown future waits for
# in-flight admin requests (e.g. a slow /pools/{pool}/stats) to finish once
# drain.signal().changed() resolves; independent of, but defaulted equal to,
# the existing frontend drain_timeout_ms so both planes exit within the same
# operator-configured bound.
admin_drain_timeout_ms:
  env: PGPOOL_ADMIN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS
  flag: --admin-drain-timeout-ms
  default: 30000        # 30s; matches RuntimePlan::admin_drain_timeout() default and the existing --drain-timeout-ms

# Frontend bind, backend endpoint, backend connect timeout, frontend drain
# timeout, and pool acquire timeout are unchanged from WI #1288/#1289
# (--bind, --backend-host, --backend-port, --backend-connect-timeout-ms,
# --drain-timeout-ms, --pool-acquire-timeout-ms); listed here only for
# traceability, not redefined by this TD.

  - id: admin-plane-all-routes-respond-h2c-and-http11
    capability_id: standard-operational-endpoints
    claim_id: served-probes-and-drain-flip
    name: admin plane serves all R1 routes on h2c and HTTP/1.1
    command: cargo test -p pgpool --test admin_plane all_routes_respond_on_h2c_and_http1 -- --nocapture
    assertions:
      - a live pgpool serve process accepts an h2c client connection on RuntimePlan.admin_bind
      - a live pgpool serve process also accepts a plain HTTP/1.1 client connection on the same admin_bind
      - GET /healthz, GET /readyz, GET /metrics, GET /openapi.json, GET /docs, GET /pools, GET /pools/{pool}/stats, and POST /drain all return a response (not a connection error) on both protocols (AC1)
  - id: admin-plane-drain-flips-readyz-and-lets-transaction-finish
    capability_id: standard-operational-endpoints
    claim_id: served-probes-and-drain-flip
    name: POST /drain flips /readyz to 503 while an in-flight transaction completes, then the process exits cleanly
    command: cargo test -p pgpool --test admin_plane drain_flips_readyz_and_process_exits_cleanly -- --nocapture
    assertions:
      - GET /readyz returns 200 ok before POST /drain
      - a client transaction is opened against a live pgpool serve session before POST /drain is issued
      - immediately after POST /drain, GET /readyz returns 503 draining
      - the already-open transaction is allowed to run its remaining queries and commit/close normally rather than being severed
      - the pgpool serve process exits with a clean (zero) status once the transaction ends, within the configured admin_drain_timeout_ms bound (AC2)
  - id: admin-plane-openapi-and-routes-match-offline-spec
    capability_id: http2-api-list
    claim_id: served-contract-matches-offline-spec
    name: served /openapi.json and route set are byte-identical to the offline pgpool spec inventory
    command: cargo test -p pgpool --test admin_plane served_contract_matches_offline_spec -- --nocapture
    assertions:
      - GET /openapi.json response body deep-equals the JSON value produced by `pgpool spec --format openapi`
      - the admin Router's registered method+path set equals the route list produced by `pgpool spec --format routes` (AC3)
  - id: admin-plane-metrics-exposes-pool-gauges
    capability_id: standard-operational-endpoints
    claim_id: served-probes-and-drain-flip
    name: GET /metrics exposes pool gauges in Prometheus text format
    command: cargo test -p pgpool --test admin_plane metrics_exposes_prometheus_pool_gauges -- --nocapture
    assertions:
      - GET /metrics returns content-type text/plain;version=0.0.4
      - the response body contains pgpool_frontend_active, pgpool_backend_active, and pgpool_backend_idle gauge lines labeled pool="<name>"
      - the rendered gauge values change between two scrapes when a client opens/closes a session against the live pgpool serve process in between (AC4)
