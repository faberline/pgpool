## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid

id: pgpool-lease-owned-capacity-verification
requirements:
  capacity_raii:
    id: R1
    text: "Active and idle physical backend connections own exactly one capacity permit, and dropping an unreleased lease returns it once and wakes waiters."
    kind: regression
    risk: high
    verify: cargo test -p pgpool --test pool
  pool_modes:
    id: R4
    text: "Transaction reset isolation, failed-reset disposal, and whole-session lease semantics remain correct without the shared outstanding map."
    kind: regression
    risk: high
    verify: cargo test -p pgpool --test pool --test pool_modes
