```

The provider boundary is mechanical. `service-k8s::render::common` owns workload-neutral Pod composition and ordinary child helpers. `service-k8s::render::deployment` owns only the apps/v1 Deployment envelope and rollout fields. Existing StatefulSet rendering keeps headless Service, PVC, ordinal, Raft topology, resize, and reshard behavior; no stateful input or compatibility toggle is added to `ServiceDeployment`.

`ReconcilePlan` carries the exact rendered children and an opaque JSON context. The default `ManagedService::reconcile_plan(Client)` evaluates the existing pure `render()` path and returns null context, while `status_patch_with_context` defaults to `status_patch`. Therefore Lumen and other existing stateful consumers preserve their public implementation contract and controller order without app changes.

Pgpool overrides only the planning and context-aware status hooks. Recoverable endpoint discovery failures are converted inside pgpool into a safe plan that retains the current Deployment target and records blocked or degraded capacity facts; they are not generic controller errors. Insufficient capacity follows the same hold-current path. Only an admitted target is rendered. Unrecoverable planning errors become the shared controller's plan error, apply no children, and requeue through the existing error policy.

The controller order is invariant: obtain one plan, apply all plan children, observe every readiness target, then build status from the same plan context. Pgpool's remote PostgreSQL discovery, reserve and headroom calculation, per-Pod quota, drain-before-release state, CR status schema, and metric names remain app-owned. Kubernetes Lease and CR status are control-plane state; neither local disk nor Raft is introduced.
## Changes
<!-- type: changes lang: yaml -->

```yaml
coverage_kind: semantic
changes:
  - path: libs/service-k8s/src/render.rs
    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    anchor: RenderCtx
    reason: Expose semantic common and Deployment submodules while preserving the monolithic root compatibility surface for existing StatefulSet consumers in this first landing.
  - path: libs/service-k8s/src/render/common.rs
    action: create
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    reason: Own RenderCtx, ServicePodTemplate, labels, owner references, resources, ServiceAccount, ordinary ClusterIP Service, PDB, HPA, and CronJob composition independent of workload kind.
  - path: libs/service-k8s/src/render/deployment.rs
    action: create
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    reason: Own ServiceDeployment and service_deployment with replicas and caller-supplied rollout fields while emitting no stateful or sticky-session contract.
  - path: libs/service-k8s/src/service.rs
    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    anchor: ManagedService
    reason: Add ReconcilePlan plus backwards-compatible default reconcile_plan and status_patch_with_context hooks to ManagedService.
  - path: libs/service-k8s/Cargo.toml
    action: modify
    section: unit-test
    impl_mode: hand-written
    reason: Provide test-only http and tower types for an inert kube Client that proves default planning performs no cluster I/O.
  - path: libs/service-k8s/src/controller.rs
    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    anchor: reconcile
    reason: Execute plan, apply children, observe readiness, and project status from the same context; surface unrecoverable planning errors through the existing requeue policy.
  - path: libs/service-k8s/README.md
    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    reason: Document common, StatefulSet, and Deployment workload profiles plus the optional asynchronous planning seam.
  - path: apps/pgpool/tests/reconcile_planning.rs
    action: create
    section: unit-test
    impl_mode: hand-written
    reason: Verify that Pgpool projects opaque plan capacity context after shared readiness while the existing operator and reconcile unit tests continue covering Deployment-only output and safe capacity holds.
  - path: apps/pgpool/src/pool/reactor/runtime.rs
    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    anchor: handoff
    reason: Complete the semantic shared-library adoption by consuming ConnectionPermit from server-lifecycle instead of the retired server-core identity.
  - path: apps/pgpool/tests/trust_startup_replay.rs
    action: modify
    section: unit-test
    impl_mode: hand-written
    anchor: wire
    reason: Complete test-surface adoption of server-lifecycle and server-tcp after the shared-library rename.
