summary: Backend connection pool for pgpool - a capacity-bounded (RuntimePlan::max_backend_connections) BackendPool with idle reuse, a non-blocking liveness check on acquire, and a DISCARD ALL reset-between-owners step, dispatched by RuntimePlan::PoolMode into the unchanged WI #1288 SessionHandler (now capacity-bounded through the same pool) for session mode, or a new per-transaction TransactionHandler for transaction mode that leases a backend only for the lifetime of one transaction (tracked via the wire codec's ReadyForQuery/TransactionStatus), plus a bounded-wait-then-typed-error saturation path and a plain Rust pool-stats API for the later admin-plane slice.

    rationale: "Defines and closes the transaction-session-pool-modes work root: RuntimePlan::PoolMode-selected dispatch between the new per-transaction TransactionHandler (lease boundaries tracked by backend ReadyForQuery transitions) and the unchanged WI #1288 SessionHandler (now capacity-bounded through the shared BackendPool), verified by cargo test -p pgpool --test pool_modes."

      How BackendPool::release() disposes of a returned lease:
      return_to_idle resets the connection (DISCARD ALL) and adds it to the
      shared idle set (R1, R2); close tears the physical connection down
      immediately and frees its capacity slot (session-mode teardown, or
      any lease whose session state is unknown/unsafe to reuse after a
      relay error, or a reset that itself failed).

          empty and capacity allowed a new connect) \u2014 signals the caller
          that a real startup+auth relay is required before the connection
          can carry client traffic; false means an already-authenticated
          idle connection was reused and only post-auth traffic should be
          relayed.

    x-rust-derive: [Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq]
    enum: [backend_pool_saturated]
    description: >-
      Drives the synthesized wire ErrorResponse for a mid-session
      backend-pool-exhaustion rejection (R3, AC3), distinct from the
      existing proxy::RejectionReason (which covers frontend-admission and
      admission-handshake rejections): backend_pool_saturated maps to
      synthesized_error_response() returning an ErrorResponse with SQLSTATE
      53300 too_many_connections, message text distinguishing "backend pool
      exhausted" from the frontend-budget wording so operators can tell the

## Config
<!-- type: config lang: yaml -->

```yaml
# BackendPool config \u2014 capacity, timeouts, and reset/liveness defaults for
# both pool modes. Reuses RuntimePlan::max_backend_connections and the
# session-mode proxy's existing backend_host/backend_port/backend_connect_timeout_ms
# (see session-mode-proxy-with-auth-passthrough-and-serve-entrypoint.md#config)
# rather than re-declaring them; this section adds only the pool-specific seam.

max_backend_connections:
  source: "RuntimePlan::max_backend_connections"
  default: 512   # capacity bound shared by idle+active backend connections, both pool modes (R1)

pool_acquire_timeout_ms:
  env: PGPOOL_POOL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_MS
  flag: --pool-acquire-timeout-ms
  default: 5000   # 5s; BackendPool::acquire() waits this long for an idle/freed slot before PoolError::Saturated (R3, AC3)

pool_liveness_check:
  source: "always-on, no config seam in this slice"
  default: enabled   # non-blocking peek read on every idle-pop before handing a connection out (R1); a dead peer is dropped and the acquire loop retries

pool_reset_statement:
  source: "hard-coded, no config seam in this slice"
  default: "DISCARD ALL"   # sent by pgpool itself (acting as its own client toward the backend) before LeaseDisposition::ReturnToIdle (R1, AC2); never sent on the Close disposition

pool_mode:
  source: "RuntimePlan::pool_mode"
  default: transaction   # PoolMode::Transaction is RuntimePlan::default(); PoolMode::Session reuses WI #1288's SessionHandler unchanged, now capacity-bounded through this same BackendPool

# Session mode continues to source its backend endpoint / backend_connect_timeout_ms
# from SessionProxyConfig (see the session-mode proxy TD's Config section);
# transaction mode's admission-handshake backend endpoint is the SAME
# BackendEndpointConfig \u2014 no separate per-mode backend target in this slice,
# and no multiple-backend-database/user keying (adapter-boundary epic #1283).
