summary: Discover authoritative remote PostgreSQL connection limits and usage while retaining Cloud SQL and AlloyDB endpoint identity.

    coverage: full
    rationale: "Keeps provider identity and advisory metadata above the core while deriving capacity from the live PostgreSQL endpoint."

  endpoint: { kind: start, label: "Provider-typed remote PostgreSQL endpoint" }

### Runtime accounting invariants

Discovery counts only `pg_stat_activity` rows whose `backend_type` is
`client backend`. A data-plane pgpool process replaces every client-provided
startup `application_name` with `pgpool-<pod>`, so its held remote sessions
are attributed to pgpool rather than foreign usage. The effective capacity is
the lowest runtime/configured/advisory ceiling minus
`superuser_reserved_connections`; PostgreSQL background workers are neither
allocatable capacity nor client demand.

## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid

requirements:
  effective_limit:
    id: R1
    text: "Configured and advisory ceilings may reduce but never raise the authoritative runtime maximum."
    kind: functional

  provider_identity:

    text: "Plain PostgreSQL, Cloud SQL, and independent AlloyDB primary/read-pool endpoints retain provider and role identity."
    kind: functional
