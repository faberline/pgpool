summary: Discover authoritative remote PostgreSQL connection limits and usage while retaining Cloud SQL and AlloyDB endpoint identity.
fill_sections: [logic, unit-test]
capability_refs:
  - id: platform-adapter-boundary
    role: primary
    gap: runtime-connection-limit-discovery
    claim: runtime-connection-limit-discovery
    coverage: full
    rationale: "Keeps provider identity and advisory metadata above the core while deriving capacity from the live PostgreSQL endpoint."

## Logic

id: pgpool-runtime-connection-limit-discovery
entry: endpoint
nodes:
  endpoint: { kind: start, label: "Provider-typed remote PostgreSQL endpoint" }
  connect: { kind: process, label: "Connect using caller-supplied tokio-postgres Config" }
  runtime: { kind: process, label: "Read pg_settings max_connections and pg_stat_activity usage" }
  effective: { kind: process, label: "Cap runtime maximum by optional configured and advisory ceilings" }
  facts: { kind: terminal, label: "Return provider role runtime effective and non-pgpool facts" }
edges:
  - { from: endpoint, to: connect }
  - { from: connect, to: runtime }
  - { from: runtime, to: effective }
  - { from: effective, to: facts }

## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid

requirements:
  effective_limit:
    id: R1
    text: "Configured and advisory ceilings may reduce but never raise the authoritative runtime maximum."
    kind: functional
    risk: high
    verify: cargo test -p pgpool platform::discovery
  provider_identity:
    id: R2
    text: "Plain PostgreSQL, Cloud SQL, and independent AlloyDB primary/read-pool endpoints retain provider and role identity."
    kind: functional
    risk: medium

  usage_accounting:
    id: R3
    text: "Non-pgpool usage is saturating total minus pgpool-attributed sessions."
    kind: negative
    risk: high
    verify: cargo test -p pgpool platform::discovery
  live_query:
    id: R4
    text: "A real PostgreSQL endpoint returns max_connections and activity usage when locally available."
    kind: integration
