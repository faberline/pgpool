# Pgpool

## Brief

`pgpool` is the working app id for Axiom's Kubernetes-native PostgreSQL
connection pooler. The final product name is not settled yet; until then the
repository path, crate name, binary name, and tracker label use `pgpool` as a
stable implementation placeholder.

The app owns the database-pooling data plane: frontend PostgreSQL TCP
admission, backend connection budgeting, drain-aware shutdown, pool health, and
standard operational HTTP endpoints. Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, and other platform
connectors stay explicit adapters above this core rather than being baked into
the pooler runtime.

Current implementation slice: `apps/pgpool` is a Rust workspace crate and
binary with PostgreSQL wire handling, bounded session/transaction pooling, a
single-owner dense-buffer readiness reactor for the transaction data plane, a
served admin plane, live remote-PostgreSQL capacity discovery, global endpoint
quota/drain models, and layered Pgpool CRD/operator/instance artifacts. Shared
runtime dependencies remain wired through `server-lifecycle`, `server-tcp`,
`server-http`, `metrics-prometheus`, and `service-k8s`; provider authentication
and broader external EC gates remain separate work roots.

## Boundaries

- `pgpool` owns Postgres-compatible pooling and proxy admission.
- `server-lifecycle`, `server-tcp`, and `server-http` own generic server runtime
  mechanics; `pgpool` composes them instead of duplicating accept loops,
  connection budgets, h2c serving, drain, or tracing.
- Platform adapters such as Cloud SQL Proxy or AlloyDB endpoint discovery stay
  optional integration layers, not required runtime dependencies.
- Application services should connect to `pgpool` over the PostgreSQL wire
  protocol and inspect operations through the admin HTTP surface.

## Capabilities

The baseline capabilities selected by aw.toml's `service` umbrella profile
(plus `cli_facing`, `competitive_replacement`, `kubernetes_native`,
`long_running`, and `network_exposed`) are mandatory for this pooler class.
They do not replace pgpool's product capabilities; the PostgreSQL pooler core
and the platform adapter boundary remain first-class domain roots.

### Working-Name App Scaffold

ID: working-name-app-scaffold
Type: RuntimeTool
Surfaces: CLI: `pgpool runtime-plan` - offline shared-runtime plan for the data and admin planes.; Config: `apps/pgpool/aw.toml` - project registration, capability profile traits, and workspace test gate.
EC Dimensions: behavior: `cargo test -p pgpool --test cli_contract` - compiled-binary contract for the scaffold surface
Root WI: -
Status: auditing
Required Verification: smoke
Promise:
Hold `pgpool` as a stable working app id — crate, binary, README capability
map, and AW metadata live under `apps/pgpool` — so pooler work roots can land
before the final product name is settled, without renaming churn.

### Shared Server Substrate Adoption

ID: shared-server-substrate-adoption
Type: RuntimeTool
Surfaces: Rust API: `RuntimePlan` - composes `server-lifecycle` bind/budget/drain, `server-tcp` socket options, and `server-http` h2c options.; CLI: `pgpool runtime-plan` - JSON plan naming the shared libs.
EC Dimensions: behavior: `cargo test -p pgpool` - runtime plan composes shared substrate types instead of local reinventions
Root WI: -
Status: auditing
Required Verification: smoke
Promise:
`pgpool` starts from the shared service substrate instead of inventing a local
accept loop or HTTP admin server. The TCP data-plane listener uses
`server-tcp` concepts, the admin listener uses `server-http`/h2c concepts, and
connection limits/readiness/drain are represented by `server-lifecycle`.

### Platform Adapter Boundary

Root WI: 1283
Status: confirmed
Required Verification: conformance
Promise:
Keep Cloud SQL Proxy, AlloyDB endpoint discovery, and other platform
connectors as explicit adapters above the pooler core: the core runtime never
embeds platform SDKs, and adapters only supply backend endpoints and auth
material through a stable seam.
